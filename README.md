# sopel-storethis

Rudimentary Sopel plugin to save the text of certain commands PM'd to the bot
into a text file, and pastebin tha text file on request by the bot owner.

Thrown together upon request for warrap in #sopel at Libera.Chat in hopes that
it would be Good Enough. Presented here in case it's useful as a starting point
for anyone else to write their own plugin.
